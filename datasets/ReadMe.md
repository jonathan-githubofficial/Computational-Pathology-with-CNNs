# Drag the dataset into this folder
all the datasets and the images inside will be ignored in github due to the large amount of files, so when using the dataset, simply drag your self's **unzipped folders** into this folder and it won't be uploaded in to github

the folder structure should looks like this
```
+---datasets
  +---dataset1
  +---dataset2
  +---dataset3
```
